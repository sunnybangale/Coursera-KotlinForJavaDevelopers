The **Kotlin** programming language is a modern language that gives you more power for your everyday tasks. 

Kotlin is:

It can be used almost everywhere Java is used today: for server-side development, Android apps, and much more. 

**Kotlin** is 100% compatible with all existing Java frameworks, and has good tooling support. Itâ€™s a pragmatic language with a very low learning curve, and can be quickly grasped by Java developers. **Kotlin** code might be compiled not only to JVM bytecode but to JavaScript and Native code as well, but this course is focused on Kotlin/JVM.
